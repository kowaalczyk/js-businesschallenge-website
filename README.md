# js-businesschallenge-website
My 1st published website - www.businesschallenge.pl

During the creation of this project, I learned basics of Node.js, Express framework, Angular, and the Material Design framework. I am glad that I managed to complete everything in time, even though there is a lot to change in my code.

I had to stick to the deadline (otherwise entire competition would not take place), and because I was already occupied with projects at the University, a lot of things were left unfinished - in particular:
1. There is no database. While creatng this, I was learning about MEAN stack so natural choice was MongoDB. Unfortunately, for some reason polish characters were improperly translated when Angular was imporing strings for the DB. I was unable to troubleshoot this bug and had to put all data as json objects within angular controllers, which is an awful solution, but works. I plan to add proper DB and API during the summer break, when I will finally have some spare time.
2. There is no CMS, but I plan on writing it as soon as I work out the database fix.
3. Front end has plenty of quick fixes - the priority was to fix every bug asap, so I didn't have enough time to learn how to do everything properly in angular - most of the fixes were made directly in hsbc.css. I was already used to working with bare css, and it was a natural way to go.

Note that this was created in december 2016, based only on knowledge from tutorials, stackoverflow and trial-and-error. During my studies I will hopefully learn how to properly write a web app and this code will look like a joke, but for now I am just happy it does the job.

Feel free to let me know if You have any tips/suggestions!
